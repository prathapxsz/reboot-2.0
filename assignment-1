#Problem 1     Block System call : 

	#block system call for date command 
	#that means you don't have to uninstall date command but if you run kernel must not accept 
	#do the same Firefox as well
Answer :-
	#First know the path to date command
	$ which date
	#Remove execution permissions to date command
	#We can put read permissions for all users and remove all other permissions using 4
	$ chmod 444 /usr/bin/date

	#For firefox
	$ which date
	$ chmod 444 /usr/bin/firefox 

#Problem 2 :  play with directory 

Answer :-
	#create a directory without name from command line
	$ mkdir " "

	#create a directory with name "-okgoogle"

	$ mkdir -- -okgoogle
	# -- will be used to tell bash everything coming next should be interpreted as text or string
	# We need to use (--) because if we use -okgoole alone, It interprets everything after -  as an option
	

#Problem 3 :  create a directory structure 
#Note :   You are only allowed to use a single command and only one time

Answer :- 
	
	$ mkdir -p A/{B/{G/K/Reboot.txt,H/J/Reboot.txt},C/{I/J/Reboot.txt,J/L/Reboot.txt},D/{F/L/Reboot.txt,E/M/reboot.txt}}


#Problem 4.  share and files and folder 

Answer :-

	$ adduser jack
	$ adduser jill
	$ sudo passwd jack
	$ sudo passwd jill
	#Login into jack and change permissions for jack folder under home to 777 and do same to jill as well
	$ chmod 777 /home/jack
	$ mkdir jack1 jack2
	$ mkdir jack.txt
	$ chmod 666 jack.txt
	$ chmod 777 jack1 jack2
	#Login with jill
	$ mkdir jill1 jill2
	$ mkdir jill.txt
	$ chmod 777 /home/jill
	$ chmod 666 jill.txt
	$ chmod 777 jill1 jill2
	#Now we can swap from either jack or jill accounts 	
	$ mv jill1 jill2 jill.txt  /home/jack/
	$ cd /home/jack
	$ mv jack1 jack2 jack.txt /home/jill
