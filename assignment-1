#Problem 1     Block System call : 

#    block system call for date command 
#    that means you don't have to uninstall date command but if you run kernel must not accept 
#    do the same Firefox as well

#First know the path to date command
$ which date
#Remove execution permissions to date command
#We can put read permissions for all users and remove all other permissions using 4
$ chmod 444 /usr/bin/date

#For firefox
$ which date
$ chmod 444 /usr/bin/firefox 

#Problem 2 :  play with directory 

#      create a directory without name from command line
$ mkdir " "

#      create a directory with name "-okgoogle"

$ mkdir -- -okgoogle
# -- will be used to tell bash everything coming next should be interpreted as text or string
# We need to use (--) because if we use -okgoole alone, It interprets everything after -  as an option
